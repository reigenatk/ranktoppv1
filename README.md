RanktoPP is a little project I made to learn the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, NodeJS). It tracks global ranking milestones in a free to play rhythm game (that I play!) called osu! I used MongoDB Atlas to store all the data, which updates every day. I used Heroku to host the backend and Github Pages for the frontend. You can check it out [here](https://osu.ppy.sh/home). My site is visible [here](https://reigenatk.github.io/ranktoppv1/).
