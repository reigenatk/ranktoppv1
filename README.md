# RANK TO PP FRONTEND

This is all the frontend code for my first MERN stack project, RankToPP!

Put shortly, [osu!](https://osu.ppy.sh/home) is a free to play PC rhythm game played by millions of players worldwide. This is a site to track global rankings and see how much "better" the top players are getting each year. PP is shorthand for performance points. Whoever has the most performance points is rank #1 in osu, followed by the next being rank #2, so on.

Fun fact: I am about rank #6000 at the time of me writing this! But of course players get better and so I will "decay" if I do not set better scores over time. So if you click on my [profile](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/14533822) later I may have a different number.
